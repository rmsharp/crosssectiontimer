               document the occurrence of responses observed.
               Sampling/recording methods include ad libitum, continuous,
               pinpoint (instantaneous), and one-zero (interval) sampling.
               Researchers have questioned the utility of each sampling method
               under different contexts. Our study compared computerized
               simulations of both pinpoint and one-zero sampling to continuous
               recordings. Two separate computer simulations were generated,
               one for response frequency and one for response duration, with
               three different response frequencies (high, medium, or low) and
               response durations (short, medium, and long) in each simulation,
               respectively. Similarly, three different observation intervals
               (5, 50, and 500 s) were used to record responses as both
               pinpoint and one-zero sampling methods in the simulations. Under
               both simulations, pinpoint sampling outperformed one-zero
               sampling, with pinpoint sampling producing less statistical bias
               in error rates under all frequencies, durations, and observation
               intervals. As observation intervals increased, both mean error
               rates and variability in error rates increased for one-zero
               sampling, while only variability in error rate increased for
               pinpoint sampling. The results suggest that pinpoint sampling
               techniques are effective for measuring both frequency (event)
               and duration (state) behaviours, and that pinpoint sampling is a
               less statistically biased behavioural observation method than
               one-zero sampling.",

              measures of error variability. Although the present simulation
