<p>Momentary time sampling (MTS) is a time-on-task estimation method
that samples defined behaviours in the exact instant that you’re taking
data. This package presents MTS<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> in two parallel vignettes that use
different value streams for illustration. Each vignette describes the
strengths of MTS over two common longitudinal time collection methods:
(1) time duration between milestones and (2) time logging.</p>
<p>The two vignettes contain topic specific simulations that illustrate
the structure, simplicity, accuracy, and precision of the
cross-sectional time-on-task estimation method. Three levels of sampling
demonstrate the ease and relatively low impact that any need for
increased precision would impose on the sampled population. A discussion
of appropriately identifying what activities to time and how the data
could be collected is included.</p>
<p>This package contains all R functions used to create this document
including the simulation software. The two vignettes share almost all
code and text. Their individual attributes are provided by their
separate parent documents, the value stream’s defined activities, and an
R script that contains the directives of how the simulation is to be run
and what value stream to examine. The parent documents differ by three
lines: the first is the title, the second is the name of the file, and
the third is the name of the customization R code script which is 18
lines long. Thus, a user can easily simulate the use MTS with their own
value stream by creating homologs of the following three files:</p>
<ul>
<li>cross_sectional_timing_model.Rmd</li>
<li>model_customization.R</li>
<li>model_defined_activities.csv</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="theoretical-background">Theoretical Background<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#theoretical-background"></a>
</h3>
<p>Use of MTS assumes that the durations of the tasks of interest are
sufficiently long as to be readily detected. Tasks of a momentary nature
are not measured without bias. Multiple animal and human studies as well
as simulations have demonstrated that instantaneous sampling is
efficient and unbiased for behavior of greater than momentary duration

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#purpose"></a>
</h2>
<p>Management of a value stream requires adequate estimates of the
resources used to create value, with time-on-task being a direct measure
of the primary resource<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> creating the value. The need to obtain
quality estimates of these times on the various tasks in a value stream
is the motivation to provide these tools and to advocate for the use of
MTS (a cross-sectional time-on-task estimation method).</p>
<p>In the following example, estimates are obtained of how much time is
spent on specific activities by various actors<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> responsible for the
success of the selection and training of predictive models. Time-on-task
data provide a fundamental metric used to identify those areas where
improvement opportunities exist.</p>
<p>Detailed planning regarding questions to be addressed is required
prior to creating the list of activities to be time. (See <a href="#selection-of-activities-to-be-timed">Selection of Activities to
be Timed</a>.)</p>
<p>A benefit of time-on-task studies is that they provide hard data
regarding how time is spent and how much of it directly contributes to
our primary goals. A second benefit is that these data allow each class
of actor to advocate for modifying the way their time is being used to
improve their work environment and productivity.</p>

<h3 id="duration-between-milestones">Duration Between Milestones<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#duration-between-milestones"></a>
</h3>
<p>Studies that measure duration between value stream milestones have
the following weaknesses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good estimates of duration between value stream milestones require
multiple observations per milestone interval and observing the entire
value stream (entire duration) multipole times.
<ul>
<li>This means little information is obtained until multiple full passes
through the value stream have occurred. Thus, no data driven
improvements can be implemented while waiting for p=completion of those
complete passers to occur. This represent an unacceptable lost
opportunity cost for those value streams taking any approciable amount
of time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Measures of duration between milestones provide no insight into
percent effort expended to create value within the duration.
<ul>
<li>Thus, once you have estimates of duration between milestones, you
remain blind to how the resources were being used within that
duration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Milestones do not provide detail available through use of specific
tasks.
<ul>
<li>Milestones, by there nature, are reached through multiple actions of
a few to many different types. The percent of effort and the pattern of
effort in those actions remains unknown.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Milestones impose a linear view of work while the value stream may
contain several important feedback loops.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="time-logging">Time Logging<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#time-logging"></a>
</h3>
<p>Longitudinal time-on-task estimation methods that call for
representative actors within each group to log time on tasks during
their work day have the weaknesses listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Failure rate in logging activities can be high.</li>
<li>Recall of the amount of time spent is often wrong, resulting in an
artificially inflated variance.</li>
<li>Preconceptions of how time should be spent biases recalled
durations.</li>
<li>Keeping, collecting, and analyzing logs requires significant
administrative overhead.</li>
<li>The biases described in earlier points makes interpretation of
results difficult.</li>
<li>The longitudinal collection of data requires a long data collection
phase before any analyses can begin.</li>
<li>Variance among different projects is anticipated to be high, which
further complicates analysis since all projects have to have completed
all phases of the projects under analysis.</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<p>The MTS design presented<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and simulated below has the following
advantages.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>failure to respond rate</em><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> has far less impact
since failure to respond simply initiates another response request.</li>
<li>Participants do not need to recall time spent.</li>
<li>Administrative overhead is greatly reduced.</li>
<li>Bias is minimized and is effectively zero given accurate responses
by actors.</li>
<li>Data can be analyzed at any time<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</li>
<li>Variance among projects could be assessed and more accurately
measured if desired<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</li>

<h2 id="example-measurement-protocol">Example Measurement Protocol<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#example-measurement-protocol"></a>
</h2>
<p>Detailed planning regarding questions to be addressed and how and
when those questions are presented to participants is required for the
successful use of this time-on-task measurement protocol.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="selection-of-activities-to-be-timed">Selection of Activities to be Timed<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#selection-of-activities-to-be-timed"></a>
</h3>
<p>Creation of the activity list is a critical step. The process should
engage all participants to included everything that should be measured
and leave out those that should not be measured. The goal is to discover
how the actors’ work environment can be improved. Thus, measuring time
spent on activities not directly contributing to the value stream(s)
being studied are often critical. Examples, include administrative
activities, non-mission critical meetings, and dealing with work
blocking technical issues.</p>
<p>One or more individuals familiar with all potential workday
activities should make the initial trial list. This list should then be
submitted to participants for further refinement. Having the
participants help create and refine the list is critical to assuring
good coverage of possible activities and to reinforce the nature of this
as a team effort to gain insight for workplace enhancement and not as an
imposed activity designed to identify poor work habits. Further, it is
preferable that the management groups of the primary actors take an
analogous time-on-task measurement sample during the same time period
and publish their findings at the same time.</p>
<p>Some actors will work on more than one value stream and all will have
additional responsibilities specific to their work environment. Thus,
some activities recorded are intentionally defined as various unrelated
activities. The activity list could include <strong>Personal</strong> to
assure participants that management supports a healthy work-life
balance. This is an example where the inclusion of activities not
directly related to the workstream under study may be appropriate. These
activities could include references to practices encouraged by
management such as ongoing education, exercise breaks, and helping
co-workers. It is critical that these aspects of the work landscape are
clearly described so that any negative stigma associated with
non-workstream related activities are accurately captured.</p>
<p>Finding that the activity equivalent to <strong>Other</strong> in the
simulation below represents more time than anticipated may be a reason
to collect additional information to identify sub components.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="collecting-the-timing-data">Collecting the Timing Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#collecting-the-timing-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>The method used to collect the timing data should have minimal impact
on the actor’s day. An ideal would be to have a modal box appear on an
actor’s computer monitor and request a minimal amount of input so that
the modal box can be dismissed in less than 10 seconds where fewer
seconds are desirable.</p>
<p>A webpage could be used by all participants to indicate a willingness
to participate, their current availability, and provide any basic
metadata needed to ensure the correct activities list is provided and
the data collected is appropriately aggregated for analysis.</p>
<p>This webpage could interact via a web API to a background application
that contained the various activity lists being used, an algorithm for
selecting when actors are prompted for a current activity response, and
a method to accept the response data and store it in a database that can
later be accessed for data analysis.</p>
<p>Group chat tools, such as <strong>Slack</strong><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> may have APIs to
provide similar services.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>It is recommended that uniformly pseudo-random times throughout the
work period (typically day, week, and month) would be used so that
systematic work schedules will not bias the results.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="data-analysis-and-followup">Data Analysis and Followup<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-analysis-and-followup"></a>
</h3>
<p>Planning how much detail to collect and how the data will be analyzed
should occur prior to any data being collected. This essential to
preventing bias introduced by observing the results prior to designing
the analysis.</p>
<p>The primary analysis should include calculating the time estimates
for each activity. <span class="math display">\[time_{activity_i} = m_i
* time\_units / \sum_{i=1}^{i=n} m_i\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is the index of the activity of
interest, <span class="math inline">\(time\_units\)</span> is the total
number of units of the desired unit of measure within the time period of
interest, such as 560 minutes in a typical 8 hour work day, <span class="math inline">\(m_i\)</span> is the number of times activity <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> was observed, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of distinct
activities.</p>
<p>See the [description of Table @ref(tab:small-sample-in-minutes)] for
an example where the calculation of minutes per activity in one 8 hour
day is illustrated.</p>
<p>Prior to the collection of data the various questions to be addressed
should be articulated along with a description of how the provided
activity durations will address those questions. In addition to
questions to be addressed, expected relationships among various subset
of activities should be recorded for later reference.</p>
<p>This is a critical part of the analysis as the full appreciation of
our ignorance prior to collecting the data cannot be fully realized
without this record. Without this concrete evidence, we tend to dismiss
our ignorance as trivial and of no practical importance in planning our
reactions to our findings. This clearer understanding of what we do not
know will better guide our next actions.</p>
<p>Plan on using at least two sampling periods as it is expected that
the activity granularity will likely need adjusting based on initial
results. Also, followup studies will be critical as behavioral and
management changes should be assessed. This low impact sampling design
makes this possible.</p>

<p>The remainder of this document presents an example data collection in
a simulation study using a realistic design that provides sufficient
detail to assess expected accuracy and precision of the resulting
time-on-task estimates for the 18 activities.</p>
<p>The example has a set of representative activities for
model_developers.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>.<br>
It simulates asking a set of model_developers to indicate which of the
activities listed on the questionnaire they were doing at the time the
question popped up on their screen. Once the model_developer makes a
selection, that selection is returned as a result to the collection
software, which accumulates the responses for later analysis.</p>
<p>In the simulation model, these queries and responses can all be
processed in less than a second but, as described below, this simulation
is constructed so that each simulated model_developer responds five
times during the duration of each of the three experiments illustrated
below.</p>
<p>The manner in which the questions are presented and the timing of
when the questions are presented are critical aspects of the study
design but are not part of the simulation.</p>

<p>In the single iteration of the simulation below, we observe how
precise the estimates are if we include 25 model_developers sampled just
5 times a month for each of 12 months.</p>
<p>Since the algorithm is not actually modeling individual
model_developers, the order of sampling has no impact on results, which
means we simply take 1500 (25 * 5 * 12) samples per result set and
compare each to the expected values.</p>

<p>I have run this experiment several times and usually the estimates
are shown to be very close as in seen in the <em>Delta</em> column
(usually within 1 percent of the expected value). However, it is more
instructive to repeat this experiment many times to learn what precision
we can expect.</p>

<p>Figure @ref(fig:hist-1X) shows a histogram plot of the results of
repeating the simulation of 25 model developers providing 5 responses in
each of the 12 months of a year 5000 times. Similarly, Figures
@ref(fig:hist-2X) and @ref(fig:hist-4X) show histogram plots of similar
simulations with each model_developer being sampled 10 and 20 time per
month respectively instead of 5 times.</p>
<p>The variance of each estimate (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2 =
n * p (1 - p)\)</span>) is linear with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> (number of observations). This
translates to a simple method of predicting the improvement in estimates
from MTS. That is, the size of the expected percent error can by reduced
by a factor of 0.5 each time the number of samples is quadrupled.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conclusions"></a>
</h3>
<p>Prior experiments with this cross-sectional activity time estimation
have shown that about 250 samples will provide time estimates for up to
20 activities that are all accurate and precise within <span class="math inline">\(\pm2\)</span> percent, which should be precise
enough for most management activities. As this estimation method
provides unbiased estimates for activities with more than momentary
duration, no amount of sampling using actor logs can provide similar
accuracy and precision because of inherent cognitive bias introduced by
the actors’ own expectations.</p>

because the actor is away from work or engaged in an activity where the
