## Package Contents

Momentary time sampling (MTS) is a sample of the defined behaviour in the exact 
instant that youâ€™re taking data. 
This package presents MTS^[Identified as Instantaneous, Pinpoint, 
Momentary, and Scan Sampling in animal and human behavior research. Momentary
Time Sampling dominates in the human literature.], a time-on-task 
estimation method, in two parallel vignettes that use different valu stream for illustration. 
The vignette each point out advantages of using MTS in a comparison with two
established longitudinal time collection method: (1) time duration between 
milestones and (2) time logging.


The two vignettes contain simulations that illustrate the structure, simplicity,
accuracy, and precision of the cross-sectional time-on-task estimation method.
Three levels of sampling demonstrate the ease and relatively low impact that 
any need for increased precision would impose on the sampled population.
A discussion of appropriately identifying what activities to time and how the 
data could be collected is included.

This package contains all R functions used to create this document including
the simulation software.
