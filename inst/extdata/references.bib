  abstract  = "We compared the accuracy of momentary time sampling (MTS) and
               partial interval recording (PIR) in estimating both absolute
               behavioral levels and relative change. A computer randomly
               generated runs of pseudobehavior varying in duration and rate
               and simulated MTS and PIR of each run. Results indicated that
               when estimating absolute behavioral levels, duration rather than
               rate should be used as the dependent measure, and MTS is more
               accurate than PIR. In contrast, PIR is the more sensitive method
               for detecting relative changes in behavioral levels, although,
               at high rates, PIR tends to underestimate the degree of change.",
