<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>A cross-sectional time on task estimation method is presented, compared to use of time logging, illustrated with an example, and its accuracy and precision demonstrated with a simulation. Finally, a proposed protocol for using this time on task estimation technique is presented that discusses potential methods to ensure representative time estimates are obtained.</p>
<p>This package contains the R functions used to create this document and the simulation software. The specific example, which is the husbandry and veterinary care of colony animals is provided by setup section of the “.Rmd” source file and a comma separated value (CSV) file with the actor, activity, and activity descriptions. Users of this package can easily adapt the small customization script and the task activities file to simulate the study they are considering to estimate the precision they can expect for their specified task and sampling design.</p>
<div id="purpose" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#purpose" class="anchor"></a>Purpose</h2>
<p>Management of a value stream requires adequate estimates of the resources used to create value, with time on task being a direct measure of the primary resource<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> creating the value. The need to obtain quality estimates of these times on the various tasks in a value stream is the motivation to provide these tools and to advocate for the use of this cross-sectional time on task estimation method.</p>
<p>In this example, we want to gain insight into how much time is spent on specific activities by various actors<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> responsible for the success of the husbandry and veterinary care of colony animals. It is anticipated that having time on task data will provide insight in those areas where improvement opportunities exist.</p>
<p>A benefit of time on task studies is that they provide hard data regarding how time is spent and how much of it directly contributes to our primary goals. A second benefit is that these data allow each class of actor to advocate for modifying the way their time is being used to improve their work environment and productivity.</p>
<p>Time on task estimation methods that call for representative actors within each group or type of actors to log time on tasks during their work day have the problems listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Failure rate in logging activities can be high.</li>
<li>Recall of the amount of time spent is often wrong resulting in an artificially inflated variance.</li>
<li>Preconceptions of how time should be spent biases recalled durations.</li>
<li>Keeping, collecting, and analyzing logs requires significant administrative overhead.</li>
<li>The biases described in earlier points makes interpretation of results difficult.</li>
<li>The longitudinal collection of data requires a long data collection phase before any analysis can begin.</li>
<li>Variance among different projects is anticipated to be high, which further complicates analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cross-sectional design assumes that we have the ability to send a question to selected individuals at selected times and collect that response.</p>
<p>The cross-sectional design presented and tested below has the following advantages.</p>
<ul>
<li>The failure to respond rate has far less impact since failure to respond simply initiates another response request.</li>
<li>Participants do not need to recall time spent.</li>
<li>Administrative overhead is greatly reduced.</li>
<li>Bias is minimized.</li>
<li>Data can be analyzed at any time.</li>
<li>Variance among projects could be assessed and more accurately measured if desired. However, I recommend that project differences be ignored during initial timing studies.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="example-measurement-protocol" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#example-measurement-protocol" class="anchor"></a>Example Measurement Protocol</h1>
<p>Detailed planning regarding questions to be addressed and how and when those questions are presented to participants is required for the successful use of this time on task measurement protocol.</p>
<div id="selection-of-activities-to-be-timed" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#selection-of-activities-to-be-timed" class="anchor"></a>Selection of Activities to be Timed</h2>
<p>Creation of the activity list is a critical step. The process should engage all participants to included everything that should be measured is and leave out those that should not be measured. The goal is to discover how the actors’ work environment can be improved. Thus, measuring time spent on activities not directly contributing to the value stream(s) being studied are often critical. Examples, include administrative activities, non-mission critical meetings, and dealing with work blocking technical issues.</p>
<p>One or more individuals familiar with all potential workday activities should make the initial trial list. This list should then be submitted to participants for further refinement. Having the participants help create and refine the list is critical to assuring good coverage of possible activities and to reinforce the nature of this as a team effort to gain insight for workplace enhancement and not as an imposed activity designed to identify poor work habits. Further, it is preferable that the management groups of the primary actors take an analogous time on task measurement sample during the same time period and publish their findings at the same time.</p>
<p>Some actors will work on more than one value stream and all will have additional responsibilities specific to their work environment. Thus, some activities recorded are intentionally defined as various unrelated activities. The activity list could include <strong>Personal</strong> to assure participants that management supports a healthy work-life balance. This is an example where the inclusion of activities not directly related to the workstream under study may be appropriate. These activities could include references to practices encouraged by management such as ongoing education, exercise breaks, and helping co-workers. It is critical that these aspects of the work landscape are clearly described so that any negative stigma associated with non-workstream related activities are accurately captured.</p>
<p>Finding that the activity equivalent to <strong>Other</strong> in the simulation below represents more time than anticipated may be a reason to collect additional information to identify sub components.</p>
</div>
<div id="collecting-the-timing-data" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#collecting-the-timing-data" class="anchor"></a>Collecting the Timing Data</h2>
<p>The method used to collect the timing data should have minimal impact on the actor’s day. An ideal would be to have a modal box appear on an actor’s computer monitor and request a minimal amount of input so that the modal box can be dismissed in less than 10 seconds where fewer seconds are desirable.</p>
<p>A webpage could be used by all participants to indicate a willingness to participate, their current availability, and provide any basic metadata needed to ensure the correct activities list is provided and the data collected is appropriately aggregated for analysis.</p>
<p>This webpage could interact via a web API to a background application that contained the various activity lists being used, an algorithm for selecting when actors are prompted for a current activity response, and a method to accept the response data and store it in a database that can later be accessed for data analysis.</p>
<p>Group chat tools, such as <strong>Slack</strong><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> may have APIs to provide similar services.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>It is recommended that uniformly pseudo-random times throughout the work period (typically day, week, and month) would be used so that systematic work schedules will not bias the results.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-analysis-and-followup" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#data-analysis-and-followup" class="anchor"></a>Data Analysis and Followup</h2>
<p>Planning how much detail to collect and how the data will be analyzed should occur prior to any data being collected. This essential to preventing bias introduced by observing the results prior to designing the analysis.</p>
<p>The primary analysis should include calculating the time estimates for each activity. <span class="math display">\[time_{activity_i} = m_i * time\_units / \sum_{i=1}^{i=n} m_i\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is the index of the activity of interest, <span class="math inline">\(time\_units\)</span> is the total number of units of the desired unit of measure within the time period of interest, such as 560 minutes in a typical 8 hour work day, <span class="math inline">\(m_i\)</span> is the number of times activity <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> was observed, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of distinct activities.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#calculation-of-minutes-per-day">description of Table @ref(tab:small-sample-in-minutes)</a> for an example where the calculation of minutes per activity in one 8 hour day is illustrated.</p>
<p>Prior to the collection of data the various questions to be addressed should be articulated along with a description of how the provided activity durations will address those questions. In addition to questions to be addressed, expected relationships among various subset of activities should be recorded for later reference.</p>
<p>This is a critical part of the analysis as the full appreciation of our ignorance prior to collecting the data cannot be fully realized without this record. Without this concrete evidence, we tend to dismiss our ignorance as trivial and of no practical importance in planning our reactions to our findings. This clearer understanding of what we do not know will better guide our next actions.</p>
<p>Plan on using at least two sampling periods as it is expected that the activity granularity will likely need adjusting based on initial results. Also, followup studies will be critical a behavioral and management changes should be assessed. This low impact sampling design makes this possible.</p>

<a href="#simulation" class="anchor"></a>Simulation</h1>
<div id="design" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#design" class="anchor"></a>Design</h2>
<p>The remainder of this document presents an example data collection in a simulation study using a realistic design that provides sufficient detail to assess expected accuracy and precision of the resulting time on task estimates for the 18 activities.</p>
<p>The example has a set of representative activities for animal_caretakers.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. It simulates asking a set of animal_caretakers to indicate which of the activities listed on the questionnaire they were doing at the time the question popped up on their screen. Once the animal_caretaker makes a selection, that selection is returned as a result to the collection software, which accumulates the responses for later analysis.</p>
<p>In the simulation model, these queries and responses can all be processed in less than a second but, as described below, this simulation is constructed so that each simulated animal_caretaker responds five times during the duration of each of the three experiments illustrated below.</p>
<p>The manner in which the questions are presented and the timing of when the questions are presented are critical aspects of the study design but are not part of the simulation.</p>

<p>For clarity, we demonstrate with the results from sampling one animal_caretaker one time and three times.</p>
<p>A single sample: individual cage cleaning Three samples: food preparation, administrative work, and animal care record use.</p>
<p>In the single iteration of the simulation below, we observe how precise the estimates are if we include 20 animal_caretakers sampled just 5 times a month for each of 12 months.</p>
<p>Since the algorithm is not actually modeling individual animal_caretakers, the order of sampling has no impact on results, which means we simply take 1200 (20 * 5 * 12) samples per result set and compare each to the expected values.</p>

<p>I have run this experiment several times and usually the estimates are shown to be very close as in seen in the <em>Delta</em> column (within about 1 percent). However, it is more instructive to simulation this experiment many times to learn what precision we can expect.</p>
<!-- We will start by putting the simulation into a function.  -->

<p>Figure @ref(fig:hist-1X) shows a histogram plot of the results of repeating the simulation of 20 animal caretakers providing 5 responses in each of the 12 months of a year 5000 times. Similarly, Figure @ref(fig:hist-2X) shows a histogram plot of the similar simulation with 40 animal caretakers instead of 20.</p>

<a href="#conclusions" class="anchor"></a>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Prior experiments with this cross-sectional activity time estimation have shown that about 250 samples will provide time estimates for up to 20 activities that are all accurate and precise within <span class="math inline">\(\pm2\)</span> percent, which should be precise enough for most management activities. I do not think any amount of sampling using actor logs can be that accurate because of inherent cognitive bias introduced by the actors’ own expectations.</p>
