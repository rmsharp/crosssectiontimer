## Theoretical Background

Use of MTS assumes that the durations of the tasks of 
interest are sufficiently long as to be readily detected. 
Tasks of a momentary nature are not measured without bias.
Multiple animal and human studies as well as simulations have demonstrated that 
instantaneous sampling is efficient and unbiased for behavior of greater than 
momentary duration (@Powell1977-td, @Harrop1986-ln, @Saudargas1990-yg, 
@Suen1991-cb, @Harrop1993-dn, @Rapp2011-of).
